# Disbursements - Sending Payments

> "Disbursements is a service that enables Mobile Money partners to send money in bulk to different recipients with just one click. This setup can be manually executed (logging into the system, uploading recipient's list and trigger payments) or automated (requires a one-time setup of the recipients' lists and commands to effect payment)." - [MTN MOMO DOCUMENTATION](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/product#product=disbursements)
