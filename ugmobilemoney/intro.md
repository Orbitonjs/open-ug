# UG Mobile Money

UG Mobile Money is a python library for making money transactions in Uganda. It aims to make payment integrations from trusted Service Providers Easy, Secure and Accessible.

UG Mobile Money provides a simple interface for making mobile money transactions in a way that is similar to what the official Service Providers API's provides but in a more pythonic and simple way. This makes it easy for beginners to get started and also for experienced developers who have been using the official API shift.

The library also handles other underlying functions like encryption, Authorization and regenerating access tokens. This makes it easy for developers to focus on the business logic of their applications and not worry about the security and other underlying functions.
