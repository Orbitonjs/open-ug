# Video Player

The **Reactjs Media** library provides a customizable, ready-to-use **Video Player** component, making it easy to integrate video playback into your React application.

### Key Features
- Fully customizable controls and UI
- Built as a lightweight wrapper around the HTML5 video element
- Easy to integrate and configure

### Installation & Setup

The Video Player is designed following React principles to ensure modularity and flexibility. You can quickly add it to your project by importing it from the `reactjs-media` package and passing the necessary properties.

#### Quick Start Example

```javascript
import { Video } from "reactjs-media";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Video
        src="/video.mkv"         // Your video source
        controls={true}           // Show video controls
        height={500}              // Video player height
        width={800}               // Video player width
        poster="https://example.com/poster-image.jpg"  // Image displayed before video plays
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Props Overview

The **Video Player** accepts a wide range of properties (props) to give you full control over video playback and interaction. These can be divided into two categories: **Attributes** and **Event Handlers**.
